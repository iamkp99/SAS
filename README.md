Smart Attendance System
This application lets you takes attendance is a very smart and efficient way

Tech Stack:
1) Android
2) OpenCv api (Java) for facial recognition. 
3) Firebase for data storage.

How system is scalable and efficient :
1) Training on device itself. 
2) All Validations on device itself.
3) Realtime efficient database is used (Firebase). 
4) Reliability because of two factor confirmation (facial recog and wifi location).

Future Work :
1) Accuracy of Face Recognition Algorithm can be improved. 
2) Multiple Account Support. 
3) High Accuracy GPS Location. 
4) Reduce Userâ€™s Training Effort using Video Capture and Frame Extraction.
